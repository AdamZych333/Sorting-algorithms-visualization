# Sorting algorithms visualizer

My second web app written in Angular 14. Implemented algorithms: quick sort, select sort, double select sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, and gravity sort (it's not really the gravity sort algorithm, but sorting process looks pretty simillar). It is limited to sort arrays of size from 10 to 1000. You can track the soring process using step by step button and then manually go to next step. By default turned on is a rainbow effect which makes it visually pleasing to look at the process, but you can turn it off (turning it off makes gravity sort look better). It doesn't represent real sorting speeds, because animations make every operation equally slow, what isn't true in normal enviroment.
